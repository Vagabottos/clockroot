# SETUP

# DIFFICULTY

# TRAITS

# FACTION DATA
[x] Revise Plot management? Button to randomly roll a plot?
[x] Change the plot stow makeup
    Stowed: bar of 8 facedown plots
        Toggles on click for a facedown plot on board
        Toggles on click of face-up plots to manage the plots out face-up on board


# BIRDSONG
[x] Birdsong/3rd-Recruit validate rules text on recruit for no warriors left in supply: do the plot thickens before you finish placing warriors. Additionally input plot thickens instructions
[x] Birdsong/4th-Flip Add a score token +1 (possible logic for face-up plots depending on how well token management is in the Plots section)

# DAYLIGHT
[] Daylight/1st-Battle - Validate text does not state 'with two or move corvid warriors' and then if it does add corvid meeple in place of Corvid Warriors
[x] Daylight/3rd-Plot - Adjust the text to start with **Plot**
[x] Daylight/4th-Plot - Adjust the text to start with **Plot Thickens** and possible Corvid meeple

# EVENING
[x] Evening/1st-Score Logic for number of extortion on board for scoring as well as adding the score at all

# EXTRA
[x] Add a rules section for how plots and Corvids interact with bots vs humans
    Bot Interactions
        When playing with the Corvid human or bot against any boys, use these rules for bombs and snares:
        Bomb: When flipped, remove two pieces of each bot in its clearing, warriors first, instead of all their pieces.
        Snare: Bots ignore snare tokens for the purpose of targeting clearings to place or move pieces.
        If a bot would place in a clearing with a snare or move out of a clearing with a snare, remove the snare instead of performing the action. (Vagabot will continue to move after this happens, exhausting extra items.)
    Plot Tokens
        Bomb: When flipped, remove all human enemy pieces in its clearing, then replace this plot with a random plot placed face-up. (The replacement plot doesn't trigger and cannot be a Bomb.)
        Snare: While face up, human enemy pieces cannot be placed in or moved from this clearing.
        Extortion: When flipped, each player with any faction pieces in its clearing discards one random card.
        Raid: When removed, place one warrior in each adjacent clearing.
